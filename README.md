- An easier way of rendering custom Content-Elements via ["Frontend-Rendering-Engine"](https://site-core.readthedocs.io/en/main/rendering/engine/) (also PSR-14 Events!)
- Includes a bunch of custom utility-classes as services
- Will always support LTS versions of both TYPO3 and PHP - currently v11.5 and v8.1
